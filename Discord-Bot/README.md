## Setup

* to get the API i went into the discord developer site and created my bot then went to the OAuth2 URL generator which will authroize me a API with discord allowign access using the app. 

* we use the code for the .env file which also gets added to the gitignore file so you dont submit you API out which would make that API useless. 


* we will need to install pip3 install -U discord.py as well as pip3 install -U python-dotenv
this will allow for to use botht eh discrod.py and the dotenv to work with .env files also make sure you using python 3
