# CEG 3120 - Project 2 

## Setup

* to get the API i went into the discord developer site and created my bot then went to the OAuth2 URL * * * generator which will authorize me a API with discord allowign access using the app. 

* we use the code for the .env file which also gets added to the .gitignore file so you dont submit you API * out which would make that API useless. 


* we will need to install pip3 install -U discord.py as well as pip3 install -U python-dotenv
* this will allow for to use botht eh discrod.py and the dotenv to work with .env files also make sure you * using python 3 

## Usage 

* If I type the word towel the bot will respond with hitchhiker quotes 

* once i did my changes my bot would respond to typing Navi and then she would listen off a random three * * Hey listen! or Hey! Watch out! 


## Research 

* to keep my bot running I could host the script on a server get a VPS which can be relatively cheap and * * run you bot on there which would allow him to be online without me keeping visual studio up and running
